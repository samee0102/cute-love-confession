This is one of the mini projects I made while learning web development. I’m still figuring out HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I like building small, cute, aesthetic things instead of only doing serious practice. This one is a retro love-confession page with tiny animations, draggable windows, a yes/no interaction, and a bit of vibe coding mixed in. All the files are separate, so you can easily edit or customise anything — images, colours, text, whatever you like. I’m just learning step by step, mixing creativity with code, and enjoying the process. If you’re checking this out, feel free to make your own version too.

## File Structure
index.html  → main page  
style.css   → all the styling and animations  
script.js   → button interactions, confetti, draggable logic  
assets/     → images used inside the project (you can replace them)
